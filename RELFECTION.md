# 1. Can I explain what my code does?

Yes, I can explain what my code does. The code handles the core functionality of a form validation system using JavaScript. It ensures that key input fields like name, email, rating, genre selection, and features are validated when a user submits the form. I made sure to prevent any empty or invalid entries. The JavaScript functions validate user input, display error messages dynamically, and allow the form to be submitted only when everything checks out. This setup creates a smooth user experience by clearing previous errors and updating new ones in real-time as the user interacts with the form.

# 2. What was my coding process?

My coding process involved breaking down the task into smaller pieces. I started with the HTML structure of the form, laying out the basic input fields. After that, I moved on to styling to match the overall feel of the project. Once the form was set, I dove into the JavaScript. I created modular functions like isNotEmpty(), isValidEmail(), hasCheckedOption(), and isSelected() for specific validation tasks. I also added event listeners for form submission and user interactions to clear errors as they typed. Testing each part of the code was crucial to ensure everything worked as expected before moving on.

# 3. What challenges did I have?

One of the main challenges was handling real-time error clearing effectively. I had to make sure that previous error messages were removed when users interacted with the inputs without messing up the layout. Another challenge was keeping the validation functions modular and reusable, especially since there were multiple input types to manage, like ensuring at least one checkbox was selected for features. Balancing form accessibility and functionality was tricky too. I wanted to make sure the form was usable for everyone, which required a lot of attention to labeling and keyboard navigation.

# 4. What would I do differently now?

If I could do this project again, I'd focus more on accessibility and user experience. While the form works, I know it could use better aria-label attributes and improved keyboard navigation to be more user-friendly. For styling, I would aim for a more polished and responsive design, as the current one is pretty basic. Iâ€™d also make sure that error messages are clearer and fit the overall form design better. Lastly, I'd optimize my JavaScript code by refactoring some validation functions to reduce redundancy and improve readability. Using libraries like the HTML5 Constraint Validation API could simplify some processes and offer better support across different browsers.
